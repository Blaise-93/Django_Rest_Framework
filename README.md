In this project, we created a basic CRUD + L (CReate, Update, Delete + list) application whereby a assigned user can fetch an artiste and song, create a song, update and/or delete a song and it's lyric via API calls at the endpoints of the user.

We used django_restframework to achieve these task seamlessly.

Attached on the docs are screenshot of the various CRUD operations from RestAPI and PostMan endpoints.
